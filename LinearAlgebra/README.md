### Intro
This repo contains my notes and labs for `Mathematics for 
Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization` in Coursera.  

It does **NOT** contain answers to quizes and homeworks, nor 
does it have 1:1 copies of the code from the course.  

Okay fine maybe some code is copied, but 90% percent is modified 
in some way or is my original work, for example 
`LinearAlgebra/matrix_from_scratch.py` - 
Matrix object implemented from scratch in Python that supports 
all the basic operations.  

The point of this repo is to learn the course in more depth 
using my programming knowledge.
